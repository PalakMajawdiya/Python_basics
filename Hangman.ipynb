This involves guessing letters to reveal a word or phrase. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, a character onscreen is \"hanged\".One player, the \"host,\" makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing.\n"," Whenever the players guess a letter that is not in the secret word they get a strike that brings them closer to losing. To show this, the host draws a simple stick figure of a man being hung, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer.If the players get every letter of the word before the host finishes drawing then they win.
